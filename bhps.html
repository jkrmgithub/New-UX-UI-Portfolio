            <h3>Summary:</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I collaborated with a team of three dedicated designers to redesign the website of the British Hedgehog Preservation Society, focusing on improving the ease of accessing information. The organisation is committed to the conservation and welfare of hedgehogs in the UK. Our redesign aimed to enhance user experience, making it simpler for visitors to find resources, participate in conservation efforts, and support the society's initiatives.</p>

            <h3>My Role:</h3>
            <br>
            <p>In this project, I was responsible for creating high-fidelity prototypes, conducting usability testing to ensure the design met user needs, and performing competitive research to benchmark our solutions against other leading conservation websites.</p>

                To inform our redesign approach comprehensively, we conducted a variety of research activities. This included 4 in-depth interviews with stakeholders and potential users of the British Hedgehog Preservation Society's website. These interviews provided nuanced insights into user perspectives, challenges they face, and their expectations from the website. Additionally, we designed and deployed a survey, gathering feedback from a wider audience to validate our interview findings and identify broader trends in user preferences. Alongside this, we developed and asked 20 interview questions designed to uncover specific user needs and preferences. Our research highlighted a strong desire among users for more educational resources and improved navigation on animal preservation websites. Notably, 75% of participants expressed that animal preservation is of significant importance to them, underscoring the urgency of enhancing educational content and usability on the website.

Users highlighted a pressing need for enhanced educational resources, including informative articles, guides on creating hedgehog-friendly habitats, and educational videos. They also emphasised the importance of easy navigation to quickly locate information on hedgehog conservation, including habitat preservation tips, rescue guidance, and donation opportunities. Understanding these findings guided our efforts to prioritise content visibility, usability, and educational outreach in the redesign process.</p>

            Wildlife advocates are concerned about animal preservation. We believe that by providing access to resources on integrating wildlife protection into urban planning projects and policies, best practices for balancing human urban development needs and animal preservation, tools for raising awareness about the importance of animal preservation, and guidance on applying sustainable practices in everyday life, they will feel more equipped to engage in preservation efforts.

                    Our brainstorming sessions were dynamic and collaborative, employing the "I like, I love, What if" approach to generate innovative ideas for the British Hedgehog Preservation Society's website redesign. We explored various possibilities to enhance user engagement and satisfaction, drawing inspiration from successful UI designs and incorporating user insights gathered from interviews and research. These sessions fostered creativity and facilitated the development of creative solutions aligned with both user needs and organisational goals.

                    The Feature Prioritisation Matrix was a pivotal tool used to effectively allocate resources and prioritise development efforts during the redesign process. By systematically evaluating each feature based on its impact on user experience and alignment with project goals, we ensured that high-impact functionalities such as educational resources, intuitive navigation, and interactive engagement tools were prioritised. This approach enabled us to focus our efforts on delivering a website that not only meets user expectations but also supports the British Hedgehog Preservation Society's mission of conservation and public awareness effectively.

            Our UX Scenario and Storyboard sessions were instrumental in visualising user interactions and journeys throughout the British Hedgehog Preservation Society's website redesign process. We meticulously crafted scenarios that depicted typical user experiences, from discovering the website to engaging with key features such as educational resources and conservation initiatives. These visual narratives helped us anticipate user needs and pain points, ensuring that our design solutions were intuitive and user-centric.
            <br>
            <br>
            Using storyboards, we mapped out the step-by-step sequences of user interactions with the website, illustrating how users would navigate through various sections and engage with different functionalities. This approach not only clarified the user journey but also guided the development of interface designs and interactive elements. By aligning our designs with these scenarios, we aimed to create a seamless and enjoyable experience for visitors, encouraging them to explore, learn, and actively contribute to hedgehog conservation efforts.

            <h5>Usability testing was conducted at various stages to refine our designs:</h5>
            <br>
            <ul class="research-section-list">
                <li>3 tests on low-fidelity prototypes (desktop and mobile) provided initial user feedback</li>
                <li>3 tests on high-fidelity prototypes (desktop - 1st iteration) further validated design improvements</li>
                <li>Tests focused on evaluating navigation, the homepage layout, the FAQ page usability, and the First Aid page functionality.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                These rigorous testing phases ensured that our redesigned website meets user expectations for intuitive navigation and access to critical information on hedgehog conservation.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Our usability testing process was pivotal in validating and refining our design decisions at each stage of development. We conducted 3 rounds of tests on low-fidelity prototypes for both desktop and mobile platforms, gathering initial feedback on usability, content organisation, and navigation clarity. Insights from these tests informed iterative improvements before progressing to high-fidelity prototypes. During the subsequent 3 tests on high-fidelity prototypes (desktop - 1st iteration), we focused on refining navigation structures, evaluating the homepage layout for visual appeal and information accessibility, assessing the usability of the FAQ page for clarity and relevance, and testing the functionality of the First Aid page for effectiveness in providing actionable guidance.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Each round of testing provided valuable insights that allowed us to fine-tune the website to meet user expectations and ensure a positive user experience across different touch points.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                These rigorous research, ideation, and usability testing phases were integral to the successful redesign of the British Hedgehog Preservation Society's website, ensuring it effectively supports conservation efforts and engages users in meaningful ways.
